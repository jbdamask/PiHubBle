# PiHubBle

Turns a Raspberry Pi into a hub for Adafruit Feather Bluefruit LE (Bluetooth low energy) devices. When run, it will scan the area for Feathers, register them and set their respective states to a shared global. The idea is that one or more of the registered Feathers act as a master and can set the state for all others. So, for example, combine this with a "parent" Feather running https://github.com/jbdamask/TouchBleLights and "child" Feathers running https://github.com/jbdamask/BleLights.

## Synopsis

```
$ sudo python multicast_ble.py
```
To run on boot, do the following:
```chmod +x multicast_ble.py ```
```
$ sudo nano /etc/rc.local
Add lines before exit(0):
	/home/pi/Documents/PiHubBle/multicast_ble.py &
```

## Troubleshooting

The biggest PITA for me was figuring out the handle for RX notifications. It's weird because I'm not actually listening to RX; instead I'm writing (TX) to the RX handle. [This post](https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy/issues/83) describes how to find it. My notes (for posterity):

> Turn on hcidump and run bluetoothctl. Connect to Feather, select the RX characteristic and set notify on. Then touch a wire (to send data). Hopefully, Iâ€™ll see how it turned on notifications.
> YES!!!!
> The hcidump showed me this:
```2017-07-29 14:29:03.106911 < ACL data: handle 64 flags 0x00 dlen 9
    ATT: Write req (0x12)
      handle 0x0023 value  0x01 0x00
```
> 0x0023 is 35
> Add this to my code and it works
```print(self.p.writeCharacteristic(35, b"\x01\x00", withResponse=True))```

> So what is 35? Well according to btle.py for this feather, UART handles can be between 31 and 38. I've seen 37 documented elsewhere, which caused me hours of pain
```
Service <uuid=6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e handleStart=31 handleEnd=38> :
    Characteristic <6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e>, hnd=0x20, supports NOTIFY
    Characteristic <6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e>, hnd=0x24, supports WRITE
